# Voxum plugin (indev)

This project is **not done** and doesn't work yet! Wait until further notice!

## What is Voxum?
Voxum is a proximity voice chatting application for Minecraft Bedrock Edition. This plugin allows you to enhance your gameplay!

## Dependencies
* PocketMine-MP 4.x
* [Voxum Client](https://github.com/Mohagames205/voxum-rewritten)

## How will/does it work?
> ⚠️ <ins> For Voxum to work you'll also need to set-up the [webclient](https://github.com/Mohagames205/voxum-rewritten)</ins> The plugin alone is not sufficient!


Voxum consists of a few parts:

| Name | Description | Link |
|-------------|------------| ----- |
| Voxum Client | The webclient that is used to voice chat with others. It's a bit like Discord where you join a channel and can talk to other people in your proximity. | https://github.com/Mohagames205/voxum-rewritten |
| <ins> **Voxum plugin** </ins> | <ins> **The plugin allows communication between the Minecraft server and the Voxum Client. It sends all necessary data to the client** </ins> | <ins> **https://github.com/Mohagames205/voxum** </ins> |
| Voxum Toolkit | This is a toolkit maintainers can use to easily test all features of Voxum | https://github.com/Mohagames205/voxum-toolkit |
